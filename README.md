Final Project - Boston Housing Data for Machine Learning

Website: https://steff-c.github.io/Final_Project/ 

This is the third and final  project for the University of Minnesota Data Analytics Boot Camp. Our goal is to analyze whether the variables in the dataset can be used to predict the Median House Value.  

Procedure:

-  Clone the git repo on your desktop from https://github.com/Steff-C/Final_Project  
-  Follow the steps to Run and execute a Jupyter Notebook in your environment
-   Read csv file using pandas to create the data frame 
-   Check for a correlation between the target value, Median House Value, and all the other columns using seaborn heatmap, scatter plots and multiple linear regression
-   Build and train a neural network to make predictions for Median House pricing
The template code is provided in the ‘Boston_housing_data.ipynb’ notebook file

Visualizations:

-   Create and use index.html to display graphs and the embedded Tableau analytics, featuring 
different variables and their correlations. Load https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/stephanie.core/viz/Boston_16234362163360/BostonHousing to interact with the visuals 
 
Libraries:

-   matplotlib </br>
-   numpy </br>
-   pandas </br>
-   seaborn </br>
-   scikit-learn </br>
-   scipy </br>

Dataset:

The dataset we worked with was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts:
